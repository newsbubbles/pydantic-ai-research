# MCP Server Implementation Issues

## Issue Description

We identified issues with the implementation and usage of the MCP server in the current project setup:

1. **Incorrect MCP Server Implementation**: The original `filesystem_mcp_fixed.py` uses a low-level manual implementation instead of utilizing the FastMCP framework for proper Model Context Protocol support. This means our agent can't communicate with it properly.

2. **StreamedRunResult Error**: When using `stream_text(delta=True)` with the Pydantic-AI client, there's an error related to accessing the `output` attribute, which doesn't exist in the delta streaming mode.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining both issues, we determined that:

1. For the MCP server, the implementation should use the `FastMCP` class from `mcp.server.fastmcp` which provides a higher-level API for implementing MCP servers. This ensures proper protocol compliance and better interoperability with clients, including type-safe requests and responses using Pydantic models.

2. The correct implementation should use Pydantic models for requests and responses, with proper typing, use an async lifespan context manager for shared state, and implement tools using the decorator pattern of the FastMCP API.

## Solution Implementation

We implemented both fixes:

1. Created a new `filesystem_mcp.py` using the FastMCP framework with:
   - Properly defined Pydantic models for all requests and responses
   - An async lifespan context manager for shared logging
   - Tool implementations using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator pattern
   - Proper error handling and contextual logging

2. Fixed the streaming issue in `agent_test.py` and `agent_test_fixed.py` by:
   - Implementing manual tracking of the complete response during delta streaming
   - Using the tracked response for message history instead of relying on `result.output`

## Verification

We've verified that the new implementation:

1. Follows best practices for the Model Context Protocol
2. Uses proper typing for all requests and responses
3. Implements consistent error handling
4. Has proper logging for debugging
5. Uses the correct patterns for the FastMCP API

## Additional Notes

The changes were made in the following files:

1. `src/mcp_servers/filesystem_mcp.py`: Complete rewrite using FastMCP
2. `src/agent_test.py`: Fixed streaming output handling
3. `src/agent_test_fixed.py`: Fixed streaming output handling

These changes ensure the proper functioning of the agent with the MCP server for filesystem operations.
