# Conversation Summary: MCP Server Initialization Issues

## Problem Statement

We were troubleshooting an issue with a PydanticAI agent that was failing to initialize an MCP server. The agent would attempt to start the server but would time out after waiting for a response, never reaching the point where it would prompt for user input.

## Investigative Process

### Initial Diagnosis

1. We first examined the logs in `logs/agent_test.log` and `logs/filesystem_mcp.log`
2. We identified that the agent was successfully sending an `initialize` request to the MCP server
3. The server was responding, but the agent was timing out while waiting for a valid response

### First Hypothesis: Code Implementation Issue

Our initial analysis focused on the server's response format. We discovered:

- The server was responding with a custom format missing JSON-RPC 2.0 fields
- The client was expecting a proper JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted response
- This mismatch led to the client not recognizing the response as valid

We prepared a detailed fix that would modify the server code to match the expected JSON-RPC 2.0 format.

### Second Hypothesis: Version Compatibility

We then considered whether this might be a version compatibility issue between:
- The Python version (3.12.1)
- PydanticAI library versions
- MCP protocol versions

We researched:
- GitHub issues reporting similar problems
- PydanticAI changelog for breaking changes
- MCP protocol version requirements

This led to the recommendation to try using specific versions of PydanticAI known to work with MCP servers.

### Testing Version Changes

We tried upgrading the PydanticAI version and observed:
- The client now requested a newer protocol version (2025-03-26 instead of 2024-11-05)
- Despite this, the same initialization failure occurred
- The server was still sending improperly formatted responses

### Final Conclusion: FastMCP JSON-RPC Format Issue

We ultimately determined this was a common FastMCP implementation issue where the server doesn't conform to the JSON-RPC 2.0 format required by the MCP protocol specification. This issue has been reported by multiple users across different projects.

## Solution

The solution requires modifying the MCP server response format to comply with JSON-RPC 2.0 requirements:

```python
# Correct format
response = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": request_id,
    "result": {
        "protocolVersion": requested_version,
        "capabilities": {...},
        "tool_specs": [...]
    }
}
```

This approach should work regardless of the PydanticAI or Python version being used, as it addresses the fundamental protocol compatibility issue.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Protocol Adherence**: MCP implementations must strictly follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 format
2. **Versioning Matters**: The MCP protocol has evolved through multiple versions (2024-11-05 → 2025-03-26 → 2025-06-18)
3. **Logging Importance**: Detailed logging of JSON messages is crucial for debugging MCP issues
4. **Common Pattern**: This appears to be a prevalent issue in the MCP ecosystem, especially with custom MCP server implementations

## Next Steps

To fix this issue, we should modify the `handle_request` function in `filesystem_mcp_fixed.py` to properly format all responses according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. This will ensure compatibility with PydanticAI and other MCP clients regardless of version.
