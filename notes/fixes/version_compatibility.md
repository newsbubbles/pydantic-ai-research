# PydanticAI and MCP Version Compatibility Analysis

## Date: 2025-06-20

## Summary of Findings

After thorough research, I've determined that the MCP server initialization issue is likely related to **version compatibility** between the PydanticAI library, the MCP Python SDK, and the MCP protocol specification itself. This appears to be a known issue in the ecosystem.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

### PydanticAI MCP Support

- **Minimum Python Version**: 3.10+ (confirmed in documentation)
- **Current MCP Protocol Version**: 2025-06-18 (latest)
- **Protocol Version in Client Request**: 2024-11-05 (observed in logs)

### Key version-related findings:

1. **PydanticAI Version History**:
   - The changelog indicates breaking changes between versions
   - Version 0.2.0 (May 2025) had significant changes
   - The minimum MCP version was increased to 1.6.0 in recent updates

2. **MCP Protocol Evolution**:
   - The protocol has evolved from 2024-11-05 to 2025-06-18
   - Changes in the JSON-RPC format requirements may have occurred
   - Version negotiation happens during initialization

3. **Reported Similar Issues**:
   - Issue #1860 notes that the user had to downgrade from pydantic-ai 0.2.11 to 0.2.6 due to SSE integration issues
   - Several users report MCP server connection issues that were resolved by using specific versions

## Version Mismatch Analysis

1. **Protocol Version Mismatch**:
   - The client is requesting protocol version "2024-11-05" 
   - The server may be implementing a different version
   - Both need to agree on a protocol version during initialization

2. **Response Format Changes**:
   - Different versions of the MCP spec may have different response format requirements
   - Older versions might use different field names or structures

3. **Installation Requirements**:
   - PydanticAI documentation emphasizes installing specific dependency versions:
     ```
     pip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]
     ```
   - This suggests MCP integration has specific version dependencies

## Potential Solution Approaches

### Option 1: Version Alignment

Install a specific version of PydanticAI that matches the MCP server implementation:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai==0.2.6  # Known working version for some users
```

Or:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]==0.2.6
```

### Option 2: Update MCP Server Format

Modify the `filesystem_mcp_fixed.py` to match the JSON-RPC format expected by the version of PydanticAI being used. This involves:

- Updating the response format to include proper JSON-RPC 2.0 fields
- Ensuring protocol version compatibility

### Option 3: Downgrade Python

If all else fails, consider testing with Python 3.10 or 3.11 instead of 3.12, as there are some indications of compatibility issues with newer Python versions.

## Recommendation

Based on compatibility reports from other users, I recommend first trying **Option 1**: Install a specific version of PydanticAI that's known to work with MCP servers:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai==0.2.6
```

This approach is simpler and has been reported to resolve similar issues by other users, particularly in Issue #1860 where the user reported having to downgrade from 0.2.11 to 0.2.6 to make MCP servers work.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, then proceed to Option 2 and modify the server code as described in the previous analysis.
