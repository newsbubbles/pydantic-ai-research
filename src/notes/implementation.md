# Filesystem MCP Server Implementation Notes

## Overview

The Filesystem MCP Server provides a set of tools for working with the file system through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). These tools allow listing files, reading file contents, writing to files, and getting file information.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the MCP protocol specification and includes these key components:

1. **Pydantic Models**: Using Pydantic BaseModel for request/response validation and serialization
2. **MCP Protocol Handler**: Managing JSON-RPC style communication via stdin/stdout
3. **Logging System**: Robust logging to both file and stderr
4. **Tool Definitions**: Four main filesystem tools with proper schema definitions

## Improvements Made

Compared to the original implementation, the following improvements were made:

1. **Strong Typing**: Added proper Pydantic models for requests and responses
2. **Error Handling**: More consistent error handling and reporting
3. **Model Generation**: Using Pydantic model_json_schema() for generating tool schemas
4. **Model Serialization**: Using model_dump() for proper serialization (Pydantic v2 compatible)
5. **Consistent Response Format**: Standardized response formats for all tools

## Tools

1. **list_files**: Lists files and directories in the specified directory
   - Parameters: directory (optional, defaults to current directory)
   - Returns: List of files, directories and absolute path

2. **read_file**: Reads the contents of a specified file
   - Parameters: file_path (required)
   - Returns: File content, size and absolute path

3. **write_file**: Writes content to a specified file
   - Parameters: file_path and content (both required)
   - Returns: Success status, message and absolute path

4. **get_file_info**: Gets information about a file or directory
   - Parameters: file_path (required)
   - Returns: Name, size, modified time, file/directory flags and absolute path

## Notes on MCP Protocol

The MCP server follows the JSON-RPC style protocol where:

1. The server receives requests via stdin
2. Each request is a JSON object with method and parameters
3. The server responds via stdout
4. Each response is a JSON object with results or errors

The server implements two main MCP methods:
- `initialize`: Returns capabilities and tool specifications
- `execute_function`: Executes a specified function with parameters
